                        What's the best race? Do races matter?
                    </button>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Simply put, there is no “best race”, each person will have their own opinions and banter on the relations between
                            races but the choice should always be up to the user. Races only really affect the gameplay during the very start
                                of the game; innate points can be refunded via resetting points with a Mindwipe, and players won't alienate new
                                    players for simply making a choice based on preference.
                                        The choice of a race  and its weight is completely dependent on the person. Determine what you find to be a
                                            higher priority such as, its lore and appearance, its current playerbase, its potential, or its faction-and go from there.
                                                Races don't lock you out of gameplay, nor give outstanding advantages, you can associate with who you wish, and
                                                    do what you wish.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Choosing a class in CinderRPG depends on your preferred playstyle. Consider whether you enjoy close combat, magic, stealth, or support roles. Each class offers unique abilities and strengths, so think about how you want to engage with the game world and other players.</p>

                        <p>Races are integral to many aspects and themes of Cinder. They cannot be changed, but a player's gameplay does not require implication with races, and can simply see them as cosmetic if they feel the need to. </p>

                        <p>You can reset your skills, including initial points added by your race, by using a Mindwipe Tonic. The first one can be obtained in the AllHollows Crypts Dungeon, in shard 1.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Generally it's always safe to pick classes depending on your current situation, or simply based on personal preference. If you're playing with friends that intend on spending points in combat classes, then why not buff them with Apothecary potions, provide cover fire with destruction magic or arrows, or gather resources and funds with better efficacy via the Treasure Hunter, Collector, and Thief classes?</p>

                        <p>Repair kits fix the item in your first slot, while Armor repair kits fix the entire set of armor you are currently wearing. <br> These are crucial during longer fights and for general QoL. They both can be found within Woven Sacks & Treasure Chests, but can also be crafted.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>It seems like your launcher is using 32-bit Java. If your operating system is also 32-bit, unfortunately, you're limited to 1 gig. However, if you have a 64-bit system, try downloading 64-bit Java. Minecraft usually recognizes the latest Java installation, allowing for increased memory options. Keep in mind, it's not recommended to allocate more than <I>6 GB</I>, 3-6 is the sweet spot.</p>

                        <p>Shares are a premium currency, given with every purchase and redeemed monthly by supporter ranks. The amount of shares gained varies with the price of the purchase, with a significant boost to server-wide bonuses, such as crate key explosions. <br> Various items can be bought using shares in the supporter shop, located behind the guild hall.</p>
